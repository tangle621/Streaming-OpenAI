A set of challenges that need to be solve to implement the specification. In a perfomant and reliable way.



- Parse a stream of JSON data coming as a stream of tokens.
- JSON Closer, close a JSON object that is not closed yet.
- Detect if inside a key or inside a value.
- Wait for the whole key.
- Early true/false detection.
- Early key detection. Based on schema. Key uniqueness.
- Key only, set value on null on waiting for the value.
- Providate delta between the previous data and the current data. In a valid format.
- Detect if the data is valid JSON.
- Path detection. Get the current data path of the current entity.
- COMPLETED status detection. Return the status on the correct message.
- Index increment. Increment an index for each entity.
- Progressive mode return the Key/Value
- Realtime mode return the key and partial value.
- One by one mode return the whole entity.
- Batch mode return the whole payload.
- Handle escaped characters.
